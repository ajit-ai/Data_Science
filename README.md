### Libraries:

1. Numpy: Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.

2. Pandas: This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
3. metplotlib: This library is used to draw visualizations.
4. Seaborn: This library is used to draw visualizations.
5. scipy: 
6. sklearn: This module contains multiple libraries are having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
7. XGBoost: This contains the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm which is one of the algorithms which helps us to achieve high accuracy on predictions.



### DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the study of organizing data efficiently using data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees, paired with step-by-step procedures (or algorithms) to solve problems effectively. Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while algorithms focus on processing this data.


###  transformer-based deep neural networks

Generative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video models such as Veo, LTXV and Sora.Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta AI, Microsoft, Google, DeepSeek, and Baidu.
